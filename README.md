# "Guess the Number" game

The script generates a number (from 1 to 100 inclusive) and gives the player 10 attempts to guess it. If the user doesn't guess correctly, the script gives a message that the user lost and the correct answer. If the player guesses right, the script says that the user won. In case of incorrect answers, a hint is given about the number that the user entered - it is more or less than the guessed one.
<br> The number can be checked in console.
